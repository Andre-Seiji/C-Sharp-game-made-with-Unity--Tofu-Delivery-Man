 This project is a C# drift game. I'm a big fan of racing games and I always wanted to create one. 
 
 So I choose the unity engine since it is easy for beginners and I also wanted to practice C#. 
 
 The game has two levels, but only the first one works when I upload to the unity website.
 
 The car model was made by https://sketchfab.com/Lexyc16 and the tire marks model was made by https://github.com/Nition/UnitySkidmarks.
 
 The track used on the second level is https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/roadways/race-tracks-140501#reviews. 
 
 The gameplay, car physics, UI and the rest were made by me. I learned from YouTube Unity tutorials. 
 
 The most difficult part was setting up the handling so that the car feels under control while playing with the keyboard but also having a tendency to drift.
